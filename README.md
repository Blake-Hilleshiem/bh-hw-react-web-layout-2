## Assignment instructions:

Profile Cards:
Create an app that replicates the design. You can style up colors however you'd like, but the cards and navigation pieces should match the design as close as possible. The user name could be hard coded if you'd like, but try rendering it from a mock data object.
The profile cards can contain whatever data you'd like (images, descriptions, etc, doesn't matter as long as they're accounted for), BUT the cards MUST be dynamically rendered via a mock data object. Image should be bordered in a circle, border around the description, etc.... Descriptive Logo has top and bottom border. Nav links are bordered per the design, but do not have to navigate anywhere. The "Action Btn" piece should at least console.log a value (try logging the user object for that particular card.) Don't forget the copyright footer that includes your name etc....
